            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WOnderful are the Impreſſions which the Tyranny of <hi>Cuſtom</hi> makes in weak minds: whatſoever is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the faſhions that we have been conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with, we count <hi>barbareus</hi> or <hi>monſtrous.</hi> Amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> the common way of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Dead Bodies of their Friends, was, to <hi>Burn</hi> them, and preſerve their aſhes in Urns: but would not he be voted an <hi>Inhumane villain</hi> by a Female Parliament, that ſhould ſerve his Father or his Wife ſo now amongſt us? and yet certainly that way is more <hi>Noble,</hi> and more <hi>Neat,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to the <hi>Fire,</hi> the moſt excellent to the Elements, Enemy to putreraction and ſtench, Neighbour to Heaven it ſelf, and an emblem of Immortality, or ſhadow of Divinity, rather than
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43549:3"/>to the <hi>Earth,</hi> which is the ſink of the World, and Mother of Corruption, there to be devoured by <hi>Worms,</hi> the extreameſt indignity and affront that can be offered to Humane Nature. But waving this, as reliſhing too much of the Paradox, with what a peeviſh and obſtinate ſimplicity people are wedded to their little old frivolous Cuſtoms, can ſcarce appear in any thing more; than upon the late moſt neceſſary and profitable Act <hi>for Burying in Woollen,</hi> whereby not onely our Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture is encouraged, but a vaſt quantity of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen heretofore idly buried in the Earth, will by this means be preſerved for <hi>making of Paper at home,</hi> a Commodity much wanted, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently on a double account, a very conſiderable advantage accrue to the Nation. Now what could in it ſelf be more indifferent, than whether the Dead were wrapt in Linnen or Woollen? and yet not a few ignorant people ſeem almoſt as much troubled and concerned at it, as if they were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc'd to be <hi>Buried alive,</hi> or have their Bodies <hi>Gibbitted</hi> after they are dead.</p>
            <p>'Twas the other day at a <hi>Goſſiping</hi> that I over-heard a whole Conclave of Good-wives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doling with each other on this lamentable occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and had not the Cordial <hi>Burnt Claret</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported their Spirits, o'my conſcience half of them had ſwooned away at the very thoughts of it.

I am ſure their fare is not ſo</hi> ſweet <hi>nor</hi> cleanly, <hi>but they may have occaſion to wipe their chaps after it.</hi> For my part, ſays a third, <hi>I have the tendereſt skin in the World; if I do not wear</hi> Silk-Stockings <hi>and</hi> Holland-ſmocks <hi>of twenty ſhillings an Ell, all my fleſh is bliſtered; and if they ſhould offer to Caſe me in</hi> Wollen, <hi>I ſhould never lye at quiet in my Grave: can they imagine I can</hi> ſleep, <hi>(and ſo long too) without a</hi> Sheet? <hi>s'bodikins 'tis enough to put
